# Create hyperlinks from citations to bibliographies for Zotero

## Deprecated

**Hey, I rewrote the code and published a Python package. Check my other repo: [Syize/noterools](https://github.com/Syize/noterools)**

<p align="center">English | <a href="README_CN.md">中文文档</a></p>

This Python script can add hyperlinks from Zotero's citations to bibliographies, so you can jump from citation to its bibliography like normal cross-reference.

## How does it work?

- This script scans all bibliographies and adds unique bookmarks for each one.
- This script scans all citations and sets corresponding hyperlink to the bookmark.
- This script can also set font color and underline style of the citation, italic font of the bibliography for you :).

## Important Note

- **This script can only work in Windows.**
- **Numbered citation format hasn't been tested.**

## How to use?

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install the following dependencies:
   - pywin32
   - pyzotero
   - rich
3. Modify the `main.py`:
   - `zotero_id` and `zotero_api_key` will be used to connect to Zotero. Check the documentation of [pyzotero](https://pyzotero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to know how to get your ID and API key.
   - `word_file_path` is the absolute path of your Word document.
   - `new_file_path` is the absolute save path of the new Word document.
   - `isNumbered` is a bool value to tell the script is the citation format is numbered.
   - `setColor` is an integer of the font color. You can get other colors value from [VBA documentations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/word.wdcolor). Default is blue.
   - `noUnderLine` is a bool value to tell the script whether to remove the underline of hyperlinks.
   - `set_container_title_italic` is a bool value to tell the script to set italic publisher and container title. Currently, Zotero has a problem setting italic font for Chinese, Korea or Japanese font. **This function is tested with Chinese paper only.**
4. Run `main.py`.
